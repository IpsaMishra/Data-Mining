To run the code for Problem 1:
Open terminal and type Python Problem_1.py

To run the code for problem 2:
Open terminal and type Python Problem_2.py

Notes for Compilation:
Problem 1:
We have hard coded the value of k and the initial centers for Q1. So when we want to find out the centers for each clusters for k=2 and the centers given in Q1-2, we need to change the value of k to 2 and comment out the values of the initial centers given in Q1-3 and the values given for Q2-3 in the code and when we want to find out the centers for each cluster for k=4 and the initial centers given in Q1-3, then we need to change the value of k to 4 and comment out the values of initial centers given in Q1-2 and the values given for Q2-3 in the code.

Problem 2:
When we want to find the weight matrix for whole bag of words (Q2-1), we need to comment out the line specific for bag of words made out of list of positive words and negative words in the code (Q2-2) and vice versa.
When we want to compile code of Problem 1 for Q2-3, we need to comment out the value of k and the initial centers (given in Q1-2 and Q1-3) and also the values under Generate dataset. First of all we need to run the code for Problem 2 and after that run the code for problem 1 to find the output for Q2-3.

The csv file has been added under the name Amazon_Reviews.csv and both the code files (Problem_1 and Problem_2) and Amazon_Reviews.csv file are kept under Source_Code folder
